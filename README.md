# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
A deep learning approach to recognize static hand gestures

This project proposes a gesture recognition method using Convolutional Neural Network to classify diifferent kinds of hand gesture.

Type of categories of hand gestures used for this classification include: 
palm, I gesture, fist, fist_moved, thumb, index, ok, palm_moved, c and down
